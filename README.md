# Gravity Simulation

A simple web application that simulates the behavior of bouncing circles under Earth-like gravity using HTML5 Canvas and TypeScript.

## Overview

This project implements a basic physics simulation where circles are spawned on the canvas at the user's click location. These circles realistically obey Earth-like gravity, moving vertically and bouncing upon hitting the bottom of the screen, with a dampening effect on each bounce until they come to a stop.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone  https://github.com/lusinekalashian/BouncingBalls.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd gravity-simulation
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Usage

1. Compile TypeScript code:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

3. Click on the canvas to spawn bouncing circles.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the simulation by adjusting parameters in the TypeScript files. You can change the gravity settings, damping effects, canvas size, and more.
